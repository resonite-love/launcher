## Architecture

This is a Rust workspace project for managing Resonite VR installations via DepotDownloader. The project is structured as:

### Core Components
- **lib/**: Core library (`resonite-tools-lib`) containing all business logic
- **cli/**: Command-line interface (`resonite-manager`) using clap for argument parsing
- **gui/**: Modern desktop GUI application using Tauri + React

### Key Library Modules
- `install.rs`: Handles Resonite installation, updates, and launch via DepotDownloader
- `profile.rs`: Manages launch profiles with JSON configuration files
- `depotdownloader.rs`: DepotDownloader wrapper for Steam depot downloads
- `utils.rs`: Common utilities and helper functions

### Data Flow
1. Both CLI and GUI depend on the shared library
2. Library communicates with DepotDownloader for installation/updates
3. Profiles are stored as JSON files in subdirectories
4. GUI provides real-time UI updates with error handling

### Dependencies
- Uses DepotDownloader binary located at `<executable_dir>/DepotDownloader.exe`
- Requires .NET 8.0 Runtime for DepotDownloader
- CLI uses clap v2.33 for argument parsing
- GUI uses egui v0.22 with Japanese font support (Noto Sans JP)
- Serialization handled via serde with JSON

### Profile Management
- Profiles stored in `<executable_dir>/profiles/<profile_name>/`
- Each profile has `launchconfig.json` and `DataPath/` directory
- Default profile includes `-SkipIntroTutorial` and `-DataPath` arguments

### Branch Support
- Supports both "release" and "prerelease" branches
- Default installation paths: `<executable_dir>/<branch_name>/`

## Detailed Configuration

For comprehensive information about configuration, profile management, and troubleshooting:

üìñ **See [CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md)** for detailed documentation including:
- Directory structure and file organization
- Profile creation and management
- Resonite installation configuration
- Launch options and customization
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Advanced configuration examples

## API Documentation

üìö **See [TAURI_COMMANDS.md](./TAURI_COMMANDS.md)** for complete Tauri command documentation including:
- Application initialization commands
- Profile management functions
- Game installation and update operations
- Steam authentication methods
- Event handling and error management
- TypeScript interfaces and usage examples

**Important:** When modifying Tauri commands in `gui/src-tauri/src/main.rs`, always update `TAURI_COMMANDS.md` to reflect the changes.
